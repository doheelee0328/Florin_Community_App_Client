## Overview

A creative solution to deal with issues some councils face. Creating a community app that allows and aids in getting the residence more involved  as a community and helping the council reach their residence better. From creating, updating and delettng a complaints board and a sort of reusable marketplace, to an event boards and important bin dates. All visible on a personal profile for the user to see what they're involved in. 

## Why we developed this app?

Our app addresses several key challenges facing local councils and their communities:

- Decline in community spirit: Many people feel disconnected from their local communities, which can lead to social isolation and a lack of engagement with local issues.
- Lack of awareness of community events: Community events are a great way to bring people together and build community spirit, but many people are not aware of the events happening in their area.
- Difficulty in finding information: People often struggle to find information about their local council and its services, including waste collection schedules and recycling tips.
- Limited communication channels: Traditional communication channels, such as paper notices and local newspapers, are becoming less effective as more people rely on digital platforms for information.
- Our app aims to address these challenges by providing an easy-to-use platform for accessing council services and information, as well as participating in community initiatives.

## Planning and Delivery

To develop our app, we followed a rigorous planning and delivery process that included:

### Entity-Relationship Diagram 

To create a visual representation of the data structure of the application. It helped us to organize and understand the data entities and their relationships.

### Miro 

To plan and visualize the app's features and functionalities. The platform allowed us to collaborate on the development process, share ideas and decide on a minimum viable product (MVP) that would meet the needs of our target audience.

### Figma

To create wireframes and high-fidelity designs that helped us to develop a clear vision for the app's user interface and user experience. By creating detailed designs early in the development process, we were able to ensure that the app would be easy to use and visually appealing.

### User Research

To better understand the needs of our target audience, we conducted user research by reaching out to a family member of one of our team members, who is a local council member. Through our conversations, we were able to gain valuable insights into the challenges faced by council staff members in managing community events and initiatives.

Based on the feedback we received, we developed features that would help council staff members to communicate with the community effectively.
